	abstract = {Understanding morphological variation is an important task in many areas of computational biology. Recent studies have focused on developing computational tools for the task of sub-image selection which aims at identifying structural features that best describe the variation between classes of shapes. A major part in assessing the utility of these approaches is to demonstrate their performance on both simulated and real datasets. However, when creating a model for shape statistics, real data can be difficult to access and the sample sizes for these data are often small due to them being expensive to collect. Meanwhile, the current landscape of generative models for shapes has been mostly limited to approaches that use black-box inference—making it difficult to systematically assess the power and calibration of sub-image models. In this paper, we introduce the α-shape sampler: a probabilistic framework for generating realistic 2D and 3D shapes based on probability distributions which can be learned from real data. We demonstrate our framework using proof-of-concept examples and in two real applications in biology where we generate (i) 2D images of healthy and septic neutrophils and (ii) 3D computed tomography (CT) scans of primate mandibular molars. The α-shape sampler R package is open-source and can be downloaded at https://github.com/lcrawlab/ashapesampler., Using shapes and images to understand genotypic and phenotypic variation has proven to be an effective strategy in many biological applications. Unfortunately, shape data can be expensive to collect and, as a result, sample sizes for analyses are often small. Despite methodological advancements in shape statistics and machine learning, benchmarking standards for evaluating new computational tools via data simulation is still underdeveloped. In this paper, we present a probability-based pipeline called the α-shape sampler which has the flexibility to generate new and unobserved shapes based on an input set of data. We extensively evaluate the generative capabilities of our pipeline using 2D cellular images of neutrophils and 3D mandibular molars from two different suborders of primates.},

	abstract = {Volume electron microscopy (vEM) datasets such as those generated for connectome studies allow nanoscale quantifications and comparisons of the cell biological features underpinning circuit architectures. Quantifications of cell biological relationships in the connectome result in rich multidimensional datasets that benefit from data science approaches, including dimensionality reduction and integrated graphical representations of neuronal relationships. We developed NeuroSCAN, an online open- source platform that bridges sophisticated graph analytics from data science approaches with the underlying cell biological features in the connectome. We apply NeuroSCAN to a complete published record of C. elegans brain neuropils and demonstrate how these integrated representations of neuronal relationships facilitate comparisons across connectomes, catalyzing new insights on the structure-function of the circuits and their changes during development. NeuroSCAN is designed for intuitive examination and comparisons across connectomes, enabling synthesis of knowledge from high-level abstractions of neuronal relationships derived from data science techniques to the detailed identification of the cell biological features underpinning these abstractions.},

	abstract = {Cells communicate with one another through a variety of signaling mechanisms. Exchange of information via these mechanisms allows cells to coordinate their behaviour and respond to environmental stress and other stimuli. To facilitate quantitative understanding of complex spatiotemporal signaling activity, we developed Geometric Scattering Trajectory Homology, a general framework that encapsulates time-lapse signals on a cell adjacency graph in a low-dimensional trajectory. We tested this framework using computational models of collective oscillations and calcium signaling in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, as well as experimental data, including in vitro ERK signaling in human mammary epithelial cells and in vivo calcium signaling from the mouse epidermis and visual cortex. We found that the geometry and topology of the trajectory are related to the degree of synchrony (over space and time), intensity, speed, and quasi-periodicity of the signaling pattern. We recovered model parameters and experimental conditions by training neural networks on trajectory data, showing that our approach preserves information that characterizes various cell types, tissues and drug treatments. We envisage the applicability of our framework in various biological contexts to generate new insights into cell communication.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose Graph Differential Equation Network (GDeNet), an approach that harnesses the expressive power of solutions to PDEs on a graph to obtain continuous node- and graph-level representations for various downstream tasks. We derive theoretical results connecting the dynamics of heat and wave equations to the spectral properties of the graph and to the behavior of continuous-time random walks on graphs. We demonstrate experimentally that these dynamics are able to capture salient aspects of graph geometry and topology by recovering generating parameters of random graphs, Ricci curvature, and persistent homology. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superior performance of GDeNet on real-world datasets including citation graphs, drug-like molecules, and proteins.},
