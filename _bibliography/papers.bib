	abstract = {We use topological data analysis and machine learning to study a seminal model of collective motion in biology [M. R. D’Orsogna et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 104302 (2006)]. This model describes agents interacting nonlinearly via attractive-repulsive social forces and gives rise to collective behaviors such as flocking and milling. To classify the emergent collective motion in a large library of numerical simulations and to recover model parameters from the simulation data, we apply machine learning techniques to two different types of input. First, we input time series of order parameters traditionally used in studies of collective motion. Second, we input measures based on topology that summarize the time-varying persistent homology of simulation data over multiple scales. This topological approach does not require prior knowledge of the expected patterns. For both unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods, the topological approach outperforms the one that is based on traditional order parameters.},

	abstract = {Interacting, self-propelled particles such as epithelial cells can dynamically self-organize into complex multicellular patterns, which are challenging to classify without a priori information. Classically, different phases and phase transitions have been described based on local ordering, which may not capture structural features at larger length scales. Instead, topological data analysis (TDA) determines the stability of spatial connectivity at varying length scales (i.e. persistent homology), and can compare different particle configurations based on the “cost” of reorganizing one configuration into another. Here, we demonstrate a topology-based machine learning approach for unsupervised profiling of individual and collective phases based on large-scale loops. We show that these topological loops (i.e. dimension 1 homology) are robust to variations in particle number and density, particularly in comparison to connected components (i.e. dimension 0 homology). We use TDA to map out phase diagrams for simulated particles with varying adhesion and propulsion, at constant population size as well as when proliferation is permitted. Next, we use this approach to profile our recent experiments on the clustering of epithelial cells in varying growth factor conditions, which are compared to our simulations. Finally, we characterize the robustness of this approach at varying length scales, with sparse sampling, and over time. Overall, we envision TDA will be broadly applicable as a model-agnostic approach to analyze active systems with varying population size, from cytoskeletal motors to motile cells to flocking or swarming animals.},

	abstract = {Although existing deep learning models perform remarkably well at predicting physicochemical properties and binding affinities, the generation of new molecules with optimized properties remains challenging. Inherently, most GNNs perform poorly in whole-graph representation due to the limitations of the message-passing paradigm. Furthermore, step-by-step graph generation frameworks that use reinforcement learning or other sequential processing can be slow and result in a high proportion of invalid molecules with substantial post-processing needed in order to generate valid molecules. To address these issues, we propose a representation-first approach to molecular graph generation. We guide the latent representation of an autoencoder by capturing graph structure information with the geometric scattering transform and apply penalties that organize the representation by molecular properties. We show that this highly structured latent space can be directly used for molecular graph generation by the use of a GAN. We demonstrate that our architecture learns meaningful representations of drug datasets and provides a platform for drug synthesis using publicly available ZINC and BindingDB datasets.},

	abstract = {The development of powerful natural language models has improved the ability to learn meaningful representations of protein sequences. In addition, advances in high-throughput mutagenesis, directed evolution and next-generation sequencing have allowed for the accumulation of large amounts of labelled fitness data. Leveraging these two trends, we introduce Regularized Latent Space Optimization (ReLSO), a deep transformer-based autoencoder, which features a highly structured latent space that is trained to jointly generate sequences as well as predict fitness. Through regularized prediction heads, ReLSO introduces a powerful protein sequence encoder and a novel approach for efficient fitness landscape traversal. Using ReLSO, we explicitly model the sequence–function landscape of large labelled datasets and generate new molecules by optimizing within the latent space using gradient-based methods. We evaluate this approach on several publicly available protein datasets, including variant sets of anti-ranibizumab and green fluorescent protein. We observe a greater sequence optimization efficiency (increase in fitness per optimization step) using ReLSO compared with other approaches, where ReLSO more robustly generates high-fitness sequences. Furthermore, the attention-based relationships learned by the jointly trained ReLSO models provide a potential avenue towards sequence-level fitness attribution information.},

Yet, how adult stem cells signal across regenerative tissue remains unknown due to challenges in studying signaling dynamics in live mice. We combined live imaging in the mouse basal stem cell layer with machine learning tools to analyze patterns of Ca2+ signaling. We show that basal cells display dynamic intercellular Ca2+ signaling among local neighborhoods. We find that these Ca2+ signals are coordinated across thousands of cells and that this coordination is an emergent property of the stem cell layer. We demonstrate that G2 cells are required to initiate normal levels of Ca2+ signaling, while connexin43 connects basal cells to orchestrate tissue-wide coordination of Ca2+ signaling. Lastly, we find that Ca2+ signaling drives cell cycle progression, revealing a communication feedback loop. This work provides resolution into how stem cells at different cell cycle stages coordinate tissue-wide signaling during epidermal regeneration.},

	abstract = {We propose a new graph neural network (GNN) module, based on relaxations of recently proposed geometric scattering transforms, which consist of a cascade of graph wavelet filters. Our learnable geometric scattering (LEGS) module enables adaptive tuning of the wavelets to encourage band-pass features to emerge in learned representations. The incorporation of our LEGS-module in GNNs enables the learning of longer-range graph relations compared to many popular GNNs, which often rely on encoding graph structure via smoothness or similarity between neighbors. Further, its wavelet priors result in simplified architectures with significantly fewer learned parameters compared to competing GNNs. We demonstrate the predictive performance of LEGS-based networks on graph classification benchmarks, as well as the descriptive quality of their learned features in biochemical graph data exploration tasks. Our results show that LEGS-based networks match or outperforms popular GNNs, as well as the original geometric scattering construction, on many datasets, in particular in biochemical domains, while retaining certain mathematical properties of handcrafted (non-learned) geometric scattering.},

Some studies also suggested that artificial intelligence can help improve infertility diagnosis and patient management. Recently, it has been demonstrated that artificial intelligence also plays a role in effective laboratory quality control and performance.

Here, we show that dispersed mammary epithelial cells organize into arrested, fractal-like clusters at low density in reduced epidermal growth factor (EGF). These clusters exhibit a branched architecture with a fractal dimension of [Formula: see text], reminiscent of diffusion-limited aggregation of nonliving colloidal particles. First, cells display diminished motility in reduced EGF, which permits irreversible adhesion upon cell-cell contact. Subsequently, leader cells emerge that guide collectively migrating strands and connect clusters into space-filling networks. Thus, this living system exhibits gelation-like arrest at low cell densities, analogous to the glass-like arrest of epithelial monolayers at high cell densities. We quantitatively capture these behaviors with a jamming-like phase diagram based on local cell density and EGF. These individual to collective transitions represent an intriguing link between living and nonliving systems, with potential relevance for epithelial morphogenesis into branched architectures.},

For instance, mesenchymal migration is associated with strong cell-matrix adhesions and an elongated morphology, while amoeboid migration is associated with minimal cell-matrix adhesions and a rounded morphology. However, it remains challenging to elucidate the role of matrix mechan-ics and biochemistry, since these are both dependent on ECM protein concentration. Here, we demonstrate a composite silk fibroin and collagen I hydrogel where stiffness and microstructure can be systematically tuned over a wide range. Using an overlay assay geometry, we show that the invasion of metastatic breast cancer cells exhibits a biphasic dependence on silk fibroin concentration at fixed collagen I concentration, first increasing as the hydrogel stiffness increases, then decreasing as the pore size of silk fibroin decreases. Indeed, mesenchymal morphology exhibits a similar biphasic depen-dence on silk fibroin concentration, while amoeboid morphologies were favored when cell-matrix adhesions were less effective. We used exogenous biochemical treatment to perturb cells towards increased contractility and a mesenchymal morphology, as well as to disrupt cytoskeletal function and promote an amoeboid morphology. Overall, we envision that this tunable biomaterial platform in a 96-well plate format will be widely applicable to screen cancer cell migration against combinations of designer biomaterials and targeted inhibitors.},

Exchange of information via these mechanisms allows cells to coordinate their behaviour and respond to environmental stress and other stimuli. To facilitate quantitative understanding of complex spatiotemporal signaling activity, we developed Geometric Scattering Trajectory Homology, a general framework that encapsulates time-lapse signals on a cell adjacency graph in a low-dimensional trajectory. We tested this framework using computational models of collective oscillations and calcium signaling in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, as well as experimental data, including in vitro ERK signaling in human mammary epithelial cells and in vivo calcium signaling from the mouse epidermis and visual cortex. We found that the geometry and topology of the trajectory are related to the degree of synchrony (over space and time), intensity, speed, and quasi-periodicity of the signaling pattern. We recovered model parameters and experimental conditions by training neural networks on trajectory data, showing that our approach preserves information that characterizes various cell types, tissues and drug treatments. We envisage the applicability of our framework in various biological contexts to generate new insights into cell communication.},

	abstract = {Complex systems are characterized by intricate interactions between entities that evolve dynamically over time. Accurate inference of these dynamic relationships is crucial for understanding and predicting system behavior. In this paper, we propose Regulatory Temporal Interaction Network Inference (RiTINI) for inferring time-varying interaction graphs in complex systems using a novel combination of space-and-time graph attentions and graph neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RiTINI leverages time-lapse signals on a graph prior, as well as perturbations of signals at various nodes in order to effectively capture the dynamics of the underlying system. This approach is distinct from traditional causal inference networks, which are limited to inferring acyclic and static graphs. In contrast, RiTINI can infer cyclic, directed, and time-varying graphs, providing a more comprehensive and accurate representation of complex systems. The graph attention mechanism in RiTINI allows the model to adaptively focus on the most relevant interactions in time and space, while the graph neural ODEs enable continuous-time modeling of the system's dynamics. We evaluate RiTINI's performance on various simulated and real-world datasets, demonstrating its state-of-the-art capability in inferring interaction graphs compared to previous methods.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of embedding point cloud data sampled from an underlying manifold with an associated flow or velocity. Such data arises in many contexts where static snapshots of dynamic entities are measured, including in high-throughput biology such as single-cell transcriptomics. Existing embedding techniques either do not utilize velocity information or embed the coordinates and velocities independently, i.e., they either impose velocities on top of an existing point embedding or embed points within a prescribed vector field. Here we present FlowArtist, a neural network that embeds points while jointly learning a vector field around the points. The combination allows FlowArtist to better separate and visualize velocity-informed structures. Our results, on toy datasets and single-cell RNA velocity data, illustrate the value of utilizing coordinate and velocity information in tandem for embedding and visualizing high-dimensional data.},

At the same time, through mechanosensing, tension is known to affect the activity of Rho GTPases. What happens when these effects act in concert? Using a minimal model (1 GTPase coupled to a Kelvin–Voigt element), we show that two-way feedback between signaling (‘RhoA’) and mechanical tension (stretching) leads to a spectrum of cell behaviors, including contracted or relaxed cells, and cells that oscillate between these extremes. When such ‘model cells’ are connected to one another in a row or in a 2D sheet (‘epithelium’), we observe waves of contraction/relaxation and GTPase activity sweeping through the tissue. The minimal model lends itself to full bifurcation analysis, and suggests a mechanism that explains behavior observed in the context of development and collective cell behavior.},

	abstract = {Hydrogel building blocks that are stimuli-responsive and self-adhesive could be utilized as a simple “do-it-yourself” construction set for soft machines and microfluidic devices. However, conventional covalently-crosslinked hydrogels are unsuitable since they are as static materials with poor interfacial adhesion. In this article, we demonstrate ion-responsive interchangeable parts based on composite hydrogels that incorporate both covalent and ionic crosslinking. We use light-directed 3D printing to covalently-crosslink poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate in the presence of anionic poly(acrylic acid) of much higher molecular weight. The addition of trivalent cations acts to crosslink the anionic polymer chains together. Using high cation concentrations drives strong crosslinking, which can result in dramatic hydrogel contraction. Mismatched contraction of layered ion-responsive and non-ion-responsive hydrogels can control bending and twisting actuation, which is utilized for a gripping device. Alternatively, moderate cation concentrations permit strong self-adhesion between hydrogel surfaces. LEGO-like hydrogel blocks with internal channels and external mechanical connectors can be stacked into complex microfluidic device geometries including serpentine micromixers and multilevel architectures. This approach enables “plug-and-play” hydrogel parts for ionic soft machines that mimic actuation, sensing, and fluid transport in living systems.},

	abstract = {Collective cell migration plays an important role in development. Here, we study the posterior lateral line primordium (PLLP) a group of about 100 cells, destined to form sensory structures, that migrates from head to tail in the zebrafish embryo. We model mutually inhibitory FGF-Wnt signalling network in the PLLP and link tissue subdivision (Wnt receptor and FGF receptor activity domains) to receptor-ligand parameters. We then use a 3D cell-based simulation with realistic cell-cell adhesion, interaction forces, and chemotaxis. Our model is able to reproduce experimentally observed motility with leading cells migrating up a gradient of CXCL12a, and trailing (FGF receptor active) cells moving actively by chemotaxis towards FGF ligand secreted by the leading cells. The 3D simulation framework, combined with experiments, allows an investigation of the role of cell division, chemotaxis, adhesion, and other parameters on the shape and speed of the PLLP. The 3D model demonstrates reasonable behaviour of control as well as mutant phenotypes.},

	abstract = {Different cell types aggregate and sort into hierarchical architectures during the formation of animal tissues. The resulting spatial organization depends (in part) on the strength of adhesion of one cell type to itself relative to other cell types. However, automated and unsupervised classification of these multicellular spatial patterns remains challenging, particularly given their structural diversity and biological variability. Recent developments based on topological data analysis are intriguing to reveal similarities in tissue architecture, but these methods remain computationally expensive. In this article, we show that multicellular patterns organized from two interacting cell types can be efficiently represented through persistence images. Our optimized combination of dimensionality reduction via autoencoders, combined with hierarchical clustering, achieved high classification accuracy for simulations with constant cell numbers. We further demonstrate that persistence images can be normalized to improve classification for simulations with varying cell numbers due to proliferation. Finally, we systematically consider the importance of incorporating different topological features as well as information about each cell type to improve classification accuracy. We envision that topological machine learning based on persistence images will enable versatile and robust classification of complex tissue architectures that occur in development and disease.},
