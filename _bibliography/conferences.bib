	abstract = {Although existing deep learning models perform remarkably well at predicting physicochemical properties and binding affinities, the generation of new molecules with optimized properties remains challenging. Inherently, most GNNs perform poorly in whole-graph representation due to the limitations of the message-passing paradigm. Furthermore, step-by-step graph generation frameworks that use reinforcement learning or other sequential processing can be slow and result in a high proportion of invalid molecules with substantial post-processing needed in order to generate valid molecules. To address these issues, we propose a representation-first approach to molecular graph generation. We guide the latent representation of an autoencoder by capturing graph structure information with the geometric scattering transform and apply penalties that organize the representation by molecular properties. We show that this highly structured latent space can be directly used for molecular graph generation by the use of a GAN. We demonstrate that our architecture learns meaningful representations of drug datasets and provides a platform for drug synthesis using publicly available ZINC and BindingDB datasets.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of embedding point cloud data sampled from an underlying manifold with an associated flow or velocity. Such data arises in many contexts where static snapshots of dynamic entities are measured, including in high-throughput biology such as single-cell transcriptomics. Existing embedding techniques either do not utilize velocity information or embed the coordinates and velocities independently, i.e., they either impose velocities on top of an existing point embedding or embed points within a prescribed vector field. Here we present FlowArtist, a neural network that embeds points while jointly learning a vector field around the points. The combination allows FlowArtist to better separate and visualize velocity-informed structures. Our results, on toy datasets and single-cell RNA velocity data, illustrate the value of utilizing coordinate and velocity information in tandem for embedding and visualizing high-dimensional data.},
