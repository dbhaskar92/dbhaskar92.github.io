I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href='https://krishnaswamylab.org/'>Krishnaswamy Lab</a> at Yale University and a Visiting Scholar in Engineering at Brown University. My work bridges mathematical modeling, machine learning, and topological data analysis to develop innovative methods with geometrical and topological foundations, enabling deeper insights into complex biological behavior and mechanisms at molecular, cellular, and systems levels.

I earned my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering and Sc.M. in Data Science from Brown University in 2021, where my dissertation, <q>Topological Data Analysis of Collective Motion</q>, was supervised by <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/wonglab/">Prof. Ian Wong</a>. Earlier, I completed my M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics under <a href="https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~keshet/keshet.html">Prof. Leah Edelstein-Keshet</a> and a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Mathematics from UBC.
